<Page title="Accessing top level ThreeJS variables">
<Markdown>
  Seasoned ThreeJS users might be wondering how to access top level ThreeJS variables, like `Scene`, `Camera` and `Renderer`.

	These variables are all still in place, there's just attached to the `app` variable.

	EG to change the `Scene` background color from the default black, to `dodgerblue`, and to move the `Camera` back and up, you can access from the `app` variable and use them as normal.

	Advanced users should `console.log(app)` and see what's going on under the hood.

	<Demo title="Accessing top level ThreeJS variables" url="threeasy-changing-scene-camera-objects-i4t05">
    <Code code={`import * as THREE from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/three";
import Threeasy from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/threeasy";

const app = new Threeasy(THREE);
app.scene.background = new THREE.Color("dodgerblue");
app.camera.position.set(0, 2, 2);
app.camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);

const mat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: "white" });
const geo = new THREE.BoxGeometry();

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geo, mat);
app.animate(() => {
  mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
});

app.scene.add(mesh);
`} lang="js" />
