<Page title="Threeasy Components">
<Markdown>
  ThreeJS has no prescribed method of organising components. As a result, most demos dont use components. This makes most complicated demos very hard to read, because everything is competing with scope in one file.

	Threeasy has a simple but opinionated `Component`. It encourages splitting functionality into separeate files. This is how coding in the real world works.

  The Threeasy `Component` is a class. In the `constructor` you can set the basic state of an object. It also exposes an `animate()` function that is automatically hooked up to the render loop for you.

  Here is the most basic setup:

  <Code code={`import * as THREE from "https://unpkg.com/three@0.125.1/build/three.module.js";
import ThreeasyComponent from "https://unpkg.com/threeasy@0.1.3/component.js";

export default class Box extends ThreeasyComponent {
  constructor(app) {
    super(app);
    // setup
  }
  animate() {
    // animate
  }
}
`} lang="js" />

  In App.js when you want to use the `Component`, you must pass the `app` to it.

  <Code code={`import myComponent from '/myComponent.js';
const instance = new myComponent(app);
`} lang="js" />

  ## Example

	In this example a Box is created and animated. By storing the Box in its own file, things are much more legible, and easier for a newcomer to understand.
