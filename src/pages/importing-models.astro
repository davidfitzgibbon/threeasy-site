	At present only GLTF is supported

	To import a model you need to follow the same preload routine as with a texture. However, as with a regular ThreeJS project, we need to import the GLTFLoader. Passing this in the settings object to Threeasy will have it set up all your loading needs.

	<Demo title="Import trophy GLTF" url="threeasy-import-a-gltf-bphg2">
  <Code code={`import * as THREE from "https://unpkg.com/three@0.125.1/build/three.module.js";
import { GLTFLoader } from "https://unpkg.com/three@0.125.1/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";
import Threeasy from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/threeasy";

const app = new Threeasy(THREE, {
  preload: {
    trophy: "/trophy.glb"
  },
  GLTFLoader
});
app.scene.background = new THREE.Color("dodgerblue");

app.postload(() => {
  app.scene.add(app.trophy);
  app.animate(() => {
    app.trophy.rotation.y += 0.01;
  });

  app.scene.add(app.trophy);
